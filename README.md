# MOVIE_BOX_OFFICE_PREDICTION
1. INTRODUCTION
In this new world of Data Science, we wanted to create something special and
unique. That’s when we came up with and idea of predicting how much a movie
would make using data from the IMDb website. We scraped information from
the top 1000 movies on the IMDb website, which includes attributes like
Directors, Stars, Meta score, Gross, etc. We thought this data could help us
understand what makes a movie successful.

A. BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
We started building a prediction model which makes educated guess on a
movie’s earnings. This project isn’t about numbers; its about decoding the
magic behind top movies. We are not using Crystal balls, but magic of math and
Machine Learning with a spice of storytelling.
Join us as we explore the world of movies and data science, where we turn raw
scraped data into a useful dataset with a prediction model. This is the story of
predicting revenue, one at a time

B. BUSINESS OBJECTIVE
Predictive Accuracy: Create a strong predictive model that can be used to
forecast box office receipts for films with precision, assisting producers in
making the best decisions.
Key Factor Identification: Assist production businesses in customising their
strategy, identify the crucial elements that greatly impact a film's box office
performance.
Enrichment of the Audience: Give film buffs insightful information about the
business to help them develop a greater appreciation and understanding of the
film industry.

User-Friendly Interface: Provide a user-friendly interface that allows both
experts and amateurs to access and interact with the prediction model.
Continuous Improvement: Add additional data sources for increased accuracy
and update and improve the model on a regular basis to accommodate the
changing needs of the film business.
